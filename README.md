# Ticketminer

***Ticketminer*** was a group project created at the ***University of Texas at El Paso's Advanced Object Oriented Programming course*** by ***Extreme Software Development Team LLC***.
This program was a semester-long project worked on initially by every student individually before pairing up two times to create teams of four. Ticketminer aims to emulate the behavior
of Ticketmaster in order to allow a user to "purchase" tickets for various events and allow admin users to "create" events for the users.

## Closing Thoughts
> "N/A"<br>- Raul Pallares


> "The Ticketminer brought some rather unique tasks that we never encountered with branching ourselves to the wonders of Advanced Object Orientation.
  However, nonetheless we carried through and integrated:  Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Factory Design Patterns, and Singleton
  Design Patterns. For me, this was my first project working with a team for the whole college semester and became accustomed to managing my time in
  meeting with the group, coming up with designs, and how we can improve on the project where the testing process fell over."<br>- Fernando Remes


> "The Ticketminer project was really helpful for learning to work with a team to design a system. Working with a team is an essential skill in this
  field and I am glad I had the chance to work alongside other classmates and get a feel for how they work."<br>- Walter Wawra


> "This project allowed me to work on a skill that I had hoped to improve over my time at UTEP: collaborative development. I had the opportunity to
  work alongside my peers and learn how they worked, coded, and communicated in order to better improve my own approaches. The initial incorporation
  of someone else's code into mine was an important moment that taught me to better document and keep my own code. I am grateful to have had such a
  good team to work alongside during this project as we were able to keep up with the project and get ahead at times."<br>- Zachary Wittmann
